                       We are accessible and welcoming to all and believe that all children have the right to receive the support and opportunities they need to develop and learn.</p>

 <p>Our provision of care reflects and celebrates the diversity within our community.  We actively promote and respect the value of each child and family.  This inclusive approach is child centred, which is the key to the Early Years Foundation Stage.</p>

 <p>We aim to provide a diverse and stimulating environment for all our children so they can grow and learn together.</p>

 <p>Our Special Educational Needs (SEN) co-ordinator ensures the implementation of the SEN code of practice.  By supporting colleagues and working closely with a key workers and families we co-ordinate provision to meet the needs of each child.
