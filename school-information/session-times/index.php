                        Children can attend any combination of morning and afternoon sessions, or for a full day.  Our morning session includes a snack. </p>
                        <p>
All children are entitled to the Nursery Education Grant from the term after their third birthday. From September 2010 the grant increases to15 hours per week. You can use your grant to pay for any combination of the above sessions up to 15 hours, including the lunchtime period. </p>

<p>For additional sessions, or for children who are not yet 3, please contact our Registration Secretary Nicky on 07969 149316 to find out about our current fees.</p>
<h3>Lunchtime: 12.00pm to 1.00pm</h3>
<p>
As our setting does not have the facilities to prepare lunch, children must bring their own packed lunch.  All lunch boxes should contain an ice pack and we promote healthy eating.  Staff will sit and eat alongside the children so the mealtime is a social occasion..
