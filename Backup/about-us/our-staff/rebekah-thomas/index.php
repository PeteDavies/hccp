                       <p>I studied Art and Design and have a BA (Hons) degree in Design Crafts. I also have 

a level 3 in Children's care, learning and development. I love my role as a Pre-school 

assistant and have been working here for 5 years. I am also the Expressive arts and 

design co-ordinator which I absolutely love doing! My passion is art and design and 

I really enjoy bringing all things creative into Pre-school and seeing the wonderful, 

creative ideas that the children have and extending these further.</p>

<p>I have two children of my own, Joe is 8 and is a thriving young footballer and Rosie 

is 1 and very independent with her toddling skills!</p>
<p>

I will continue to make our Pre-school a happy, stimulating and creative environment 

for your child and I will help your child grow by continuing to extend and develop their 

own, individual interests.</p>
