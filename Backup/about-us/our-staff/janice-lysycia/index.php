                       <p>My name is Janice Lysycia. I'm a Pre-School assistant with an NNEB qualification. I've 

worked at Pre-School since 2005 and I have two children of my own. 

</p>
<p>I'd like to feel 

that I bring 'experience' into the Pre-School environment, as I love working with young 

children, and as well as being a Sunday School leader, I help run different activity 

sessions for children of all ages.</p>
