                       <p>My name is Jo Holttum and I qualified as a childcare practitioner in 2008 with a level

3 Diploma in pre-school practice. I volunteered at several different settings whilst 

completing my qualification and then joined HCCPS in January of 2009 as a practitioner. I 

am a qualified first aider and your appointed first aid coordinator. I am also the 2 year old 

lead practitioner for HCCPS.</p>



<p>I have one daughter who has inspired and changed my life, along with a loving and 

resourceful partner who often commits extra work to pre-school. </p>

<p>

I bring a range of diverse qualities to the setting and love seeing children's reactions 

to how scientific experiments work no matter how small or large. I love the 

natural environment and will extend your child's experience and follow their direction. My 

passion is craft and love seeing how children use different resources available.</p>

<p>
I will aim to reassure you and your child(ren) and make them they feel safe and secure, 

and hope that they enjoy being in a safe and nurturing environment.</p>

<p>
I will hopefully enhance your child's experiences in our setting by making props available 

as they request, by either creating, or joining them in their imaginary world. </p>

<p>
I will treat your child as my own with respect and care and listen to what they are saying, 

always taking into consideration their likes and dislikes.</p>
<p>

I will always liaise with you about your child and take into consideration your views and 

concerns.</p>
