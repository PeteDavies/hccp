                        <p><strong>Deputy Supervisor and Safeguarding Officer</strong></p>
                       <p>I have lived in the village since I got married in 1996. Both of my

children attended the Preschool, Holmes Chapel Primary school and 

are now studying at the Comprehensive school.</p>

<p>I have a BSc (Hons) degree in Biology and worked as a research 

molecular biologist for 10 years. Having my own family made me 

appreciate the importance of quality of care and individual learning. 

This inspired me to gain a Diploma in Preschool Practise (Cache Level 

3) in 2006. I have worked at Holmes Chapel Community Preschool 

ever since and love working with the children, supporting their 

individual skills and enabling achievements in a safe environment.</p>

<p><strong>I will....</strong></p>

<p>...Listen to you, share with you and care for your child.</p>

<p>...use my passion for science to provide learning through exploring, 

investigating and curiosity.</p>
