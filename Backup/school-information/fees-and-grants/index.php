<h3>Free pre-school education for all children aged 3 years and over.</h3>

<p>From the term after their third birthday, your child is entitled to receive a Nursery Education Grant (NEG) for up to 15 hours per week during term-time. Pre-school claims the money directly from the Local Education Authority and so you will not need a voucher or a certificate. </p>

<p>Any child not eligible for the NEG will be charged at our current rates. </p>

<p>Before the beginning of each term you will be asked to confirm the number of hours you wish Holmes Chapel Community pre-school to claim on your behalf. The registration secretary will be able to advise you when your child will be eligible.
                        </p>
