                      <p>
                        I am the Pre School Supervisor. I qualified as a Teacher in 2005 with a BA (hons) in Primary Education (4-11yrs), then in 2009 I also gained my Early Years Professional Status (0-4).
                      </p>
                      <p>I've worked in both private day nurseries and schools. I joined pre school in 2011 and I oversee the day to day running of the setting and implement the continuous improvement plan.
