                        <p><strong>Deputy Supervisor and Special Educational Needs Coordinator</strong></p>
                      <p>I have worked at the Preschool since 2005 and am qualified to a Level 3 Diploma 

in Pre-school Practice.</p>
<p>

I have three teenage children and the younger two attended the preschool when 

we moved here from Devon. It was at this time I decided to change career to 

become a Preschool teacher.</p>

<p>As the Special Educational Needs Coordinator I work closely with parents and 

other professionals in providing and engaging children in stimulating activities to 

aid their development in a safe and nurturing environment.</p>

<p>I will:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    Build a partnership with you and your child to share experiences as they 

explore and develop.
    </li>
      <li>
      Support and encourage your child in all activities so they can reach their 

full potential.
      </li>
</ul>
