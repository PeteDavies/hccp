                       <p>I trained as a NNEB Nursery Nurse full time for two years and have worked in a variety of Pre-School 

settings for several years. I have worked at Holmes Chapel Community Pre-School as an Assistant for 

3 years.</p>

 <p>I have two young children Louise who is 8 and Joe who is 6.</p>

 <p>As a family we have a love for the outdoors and we can often be found at our allotment weeding and 

sowing seeds and this is an interest and a skill I encourage among the Pre-School children.</p>

 <p>I have an active lifestyle which includes training regularly and Instructing in Karate which has huge 

benefits to my well -being and I try to relay the importance of exercise and healthy eating to the 

children in my care.</p>

 <p>I will provide a safe and fun environment for your child during their time at Pre-School.</p>

 <p>I will support your child to the best of my ability in all areas of development.</p>
