                            Raising additional funds for our pre-school is essential to meet our high standard of care and learning.
                               </p><p>
                            We need and appreciate your support in maintaining a high quality pre-school.  Fundraising events organised by the committee are held throughout the year.
                               </p><p>
                            Since we are a registered charity, any profits are directed back into the pre-school to benefit the children.  Fundraising allows us to purchase larger items which add to the pre-school experience.  Recently the garden area has been updated to include a soft play surface, gazebo and willow dome tunnel to mention a few.
                               </p><p>
                            Details of forthcoming events are published in our <a href="/newsletter/">newsletter</a>
